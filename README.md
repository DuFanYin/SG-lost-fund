## Project Overview
We propose the development of an intuitive web-based application designed to help individuals recover lost items by connecting them with others who have found misplaced belongings. This platform will serve as a virtual community space, where users can easily post about items theyâ€™ve lost or found. 

By leveraging user-generated content, the platform will act as a bridge between those who have lost possessions and those who have found them, creating an efficient and collaborative space for reconnecting people with their belongings.

### Features
1. Interactive Map
   - The home page displays a map with location pins of all reported lost and found items. Users can type in the location and the map will zoom into the specific section and display all the reported items in the area. With each item listing shown in the sidebar. Users can further narrow down the range by filtering keywords, date, location or category (i.e. books, personal items, etc). 

2. Lost and Found Reporting
   - Users can upload images of the lost item to help others identify it easily.  Users also have another listing option where they can ask for help when they lose an item. They can specify the time and location about where they have lost it and give a reward for people who found the item. Each listing will have a comment section which allows users to post comments and communicate with each other to facilitate collection of the lost items. After the item has been collected by the owner, or call for help is fulfilled, the listing can be marked as completed.

3. Analytical Dashboard
   - The Analytical Dashboard provides comprehensive insights by tracking the most frequently reported items. It also monitors success rates for recovered items, offering a clear view of how effective the lost and found system is in reuniting items with their owners. 

4. User Reward System
   - The User Reward System incentivizes engagement by awarding points for specific actions, such as reporting lost items or contributing to the platform. Users can redeem accumulated points for various rewards, fostering a sense of accomplishment and loyalty. Additionally, a leaderboard feature promotes friendly competition, encouraging users to stay active and engaged within the community.
