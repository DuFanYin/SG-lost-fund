## Project Overview
We propose the development of an intuitive web-based application designed to help individuals recover lost items by connecting them with others who have found misplaced belongings. This platform will serve as a virtual community space, where users can easily post about items theyâ€™ve lost or found. 

By leveraging user-generated content, the platform will act as a bridge between those who have lost possessions and those who have found them, creating an efficient and collaborative space for reconnecting people with their belongings.

### Features
1. Interactive Map
   - The home page displays a map with location pins of all reported lost and found items. Users can type in the location and the map will zoom into the specific section and display all the reported items in the area. Each item listing is shown in the sidebar. Users can further narrow down the range by filtering categories, status, and dates.

2. Lost and Found Reporting
   - Users can upload images of the item they have found or the item they have lost. They can specify the item name, item type, item description, date and time, location of the item found/lost at, handoff method, and handoff location. Each listing will have a comment section which allows users to post comments and communicate with each other to facilitate collection of the lost items. After the item has been collected by the owner, or call for help is fulfilled, the listing can be marked as completed. There is also a notification system that allows the user to view the comments that they have missed previously.

3. Analytical Dashboard
   - The Analytical Dashboard provides comprehensive insights by tracking the lost items by categry. It also monitors success and failure rates and monthly trends of items found vs lost. It also includes a leaderboard whereby they can view the number of items found by them and the users.

4. User Reward System
   - The User Reward System incentivizes engagement by awarding points for specific actions, such as reporting lost items. Users can redeem accumulated points for various rewards, fostering a sense of accomplishment and loyalty. They can used the points earned to buy borders for their user profile image and backgrounds as well.
